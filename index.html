        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>Last updated: October 2025</p>
        <p>
            Glass Express ("we", "our", or "us") operates the Glass Express mobile application (the "App"). This page
            informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information when you
            use our App.
        </p>

        <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
        <p>
            We do <strong>not</strong> collect or store any personally identifiable information from users of the App.
        </p>
        <p>
            The App may request access to your device's internet connection to display web content. No personal data is
            transmitted to our servers.
        </p>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
            The App doesn't use third-party services.
        </p>

        <h2>Log Data</h2>
        <p>
            The App itself does not collect log data. However, third-party services may collect information such as your
            device's IP address, device name, operating system version, and configuration when you use their services.
        </p>

        <h2>Cookies</h2>
        <p>
            The App does not use cookies. However, websites loaded within the App's webview may use cookies as described
            in their respective privacy policies.
        </p>

        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>
            We value your trust in using our App. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your
            information, remember that no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is
            100% secure.
        </p>

        <h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>
        <p>
            The App may contain links to external sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to
            that site. We strongly advise you to review the privacy policy of these websites.
        </p>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>
            The App does not knowingly collect any personal information from children under 13.
